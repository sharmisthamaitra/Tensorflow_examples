Repository to store Tensorflow code examples and Tensorflow projects

This directory contains Tensorflow examples and projects for the understanding and working of Machine Learning with TensorFlow.

The TensorFlow program "Image_Classification_with_tensorflow.py" employs the Convolutional Neural Network architecture
to classify color images in the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 possible classes. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images of animals and inanimate objects. Each image is 32x32 pixels. An image can belong
to one of the following classes: 
Convolutional neural network is a time tested approach for image classification. By varying the number and placement of 
convolutional and pooling layers, and their parameters like kernel size, strides, number of filters, it is possible to 
improve the performance of the model.
